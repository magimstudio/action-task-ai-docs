## Frequently Asked Questions

### AI Credits Explained
AI features use credits from your daily allowance:

*   **Smart Move**: **1 credit per 25 tasks** analyzed. For example, 1-25 tasks costs 1 credit, 26-50 costs 2, etc.
*   **AI Task Breakdown**: Costs **1 credit** per task decomposed.

**Free Users**: 3 credits/day.
**Pro Subscribers**: 30 credits/day.

Credits reset at midnight (local time).

### Sync & Offline Mode
This app works **completely offline**. You can create, edit, and complete tasks without any internet connection.

**Google Sync** is optional:
*   Sign in to sync your tasks with Google Tasks.
*   If you're offline, changes are saved locally and synced automatically when you reconnect.
*   You can also manually trigger a sync by tapping the sync button on the home screen.
*   You can use the app without a Google account—your tasks stay on your device.

### Organizing Your Tasks
You have full control over task organization:

**Drag & Drop**:
*   Long-press a task to drag it up or down to change its order.
*   Drag a task onto another to make it a subtask (indent).
*   Drag a subtask out to promote it back to a root task.

**Move to Another List**:
*   Open the task details (tap the task title).
*   Tap the "Move to List" option in the menu.
*   Select the destination list.

### What is Smart Move?
**Smart Move** uses AI to automatically organize your tasks.

**How it works**:
1.  Search for a topic or list name (e.g., "Groceries").
2.  The AI scans your tasks and finds ones that match.
3.  Review the suggestions and confirm to move them to a new or existing list.

**Tip**: Works best with descriptive task titles like "Buy milk" or "Call dentist".

### What is AI Task Breakdown?
**AI Task Breakdown** helps you split large tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks.

**How to use**:
*   Tap the sparkle icon on a task in the list, OR
*   Open the task details and tap "Break Down with AI".

The AI analyzes the task and suggests subtasks. Review and confirm to add them.

**Example**: "Plan birthday party" might become:
*   Send invitations
*   Order cake
*   Buy decorations
*   Book venue

### Watch App Not Working
If the Watch app isn't installing or shows "Subscribe to Unlock" even after purchase:

*   **Check Connectivity**: Ensure your Apple Watch is connected to your iPhone and has Wi-Fi access.
*   **Reinstall the App**: Delete the Watch app and reinstall it from the Watch app on your iPhone.
*   **Restore Purchases**: Open the Subscription screen and tap the restore icon (↻) in the top-right corner. This will sync your purchase with your device.
*   **Restart Both Devices**: Sometimes a simple restart of your iPhone and Watch resolves sync issues.
